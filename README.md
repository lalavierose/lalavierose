## Welcome To My Humble Abode âœ¨

I'm a 2003 born CS Student trying to navigate this field !
I'm currently working on learning react, and have intermediate knowledge in Java and some Python ! I dip my toes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my free time, so you can call me a jack of all trades ^^

Currently working on a chrome extension for my bilingual folks who just happen to type out long sentences in the wrong keyboard language! Requested by my sister <3

I'm open to finding people to connect and share knowledge and experiences with ! I love to sew and do art in my free time~
Thank you for checking out my page <3
